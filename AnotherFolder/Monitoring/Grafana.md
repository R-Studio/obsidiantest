# Grafana
## Grafana Operator
*The [Grafana Operator](https://github.com/grafana-operator/grafana-operator) can provision and manage Grafana Instances, Dashboards, Datasources and notification channels. Based on the [Operator-SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/).*

The following Grafana resources are supported (CRDs):
- Grafana
- GrafanaDashboard
- GrafanaDatasource
- GrafanaNotificationChannel

> **NOTE:** Unfortunately there aren't CRDs for AlertRule, AlertGroup, ContactPoint and NotificationPolicy right now. More in the [GitHub Feature request](https://github.com/grafana-operator/grafana-operator/issues/564).
